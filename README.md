## Course work

As a student, you are expected to read and present one research paper in one of the topics of human-centric machine learning and ask questions during the presentation of a different paper in the same topic by another student. There are various topics available for you to choose from; you can find more information in the "Available Topics" 
section below. To help with your presentation, you will do a practice presentation in front of the instructions, where they will give you feedback.

The presentations will be scheduled on 3-4 days during the Winter semester. As a student, you are expected to attend all the presentations and actively engage in discussions.

## Prerequisites

You are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Only those students who have already passed one of the fundamental Machine Learning courses during the course of their master studies will be accepted to the seminar.

## Registration

Fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/puBPTUMJFRJZhePu7](https://forms.gle/puBPTUMJFRJZhePu7)

You are required to enter your name, email address, student number and the list of the courses from the "intelligent systems" specialization that you have already passed, along with your obtained grade. We consider you fit for the seminar if you are a master's student and have passed courses about the fundamentals of machine learning with a satisfactory grade.

There are a limited number of research topics available, so our registrations are also limited. The final list of accepted registrations will be notified via
email.

Deadline: 31-10-2024
